## The Ford-Fulkerson Method

**Mas-flow Min-cut Theorem**: If $f$ is a flow in a flow network $G = (V, E)$ with source $s$ and sink $t$,then the following conditions are equivalent:
1. $f$ is a maximum flow in $G$
2. The residual network $G_f$ contains no augmenting paths.
3. $\|f\| = c(S, T)$ for some cut $(S, T)$ of $G$.
