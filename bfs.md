# Breadth First Search

BFS is a simple alternate to the DFS strategy to exploring a graph. BFS first "explores" all the vertices that are one hop away from the source vertex. Then it explores all the vertices that are two hops away from the source vertex and so on. In other words, BFS visits vertices in order of increasing hop-count from the source vertex. 

If each edge has unit length, then the number of hops equals the distance of a vertex from the source vertex. Therefore, we can use BFS to solve the shortest path problem.
