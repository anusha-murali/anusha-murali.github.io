### Increasing Triplet Sequence

This is a nice problem from LeetCode (Problem #334)

**Problem**: Given an integer array `nums`, return true if there exists a triple of indices $(i, j, k)$
such that $i < j < k$ and `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. If no such indices exists, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`; Output: `true`

Explanation: Any triplet where $i < j < k$ is valid.

Example 2:

Input: `nums = [5,4,3,2,1]`; Output: false

Explanation: No triplet exists.

Example 3:

Input: `nums = [2,1,5,0,4,6]`; Output: true

Explanation: The triplet `(3, 4, 5)` is valid because `nums[3] == 0 < nums[4] == 4 < nums[5] == 6`.

**Solution**

```
    def increasingTriplet(nums):
        first = second = float("inf")
        for val in nums:
            if val <= first:
                first = val
            elif val <= second:
                second = val
            else:
                return True
        return False
```

*Proof*: It's clear that if we reach the `else` part of the `if` statement, the `val` currently under consideration completes an increasing triplet.

It's now sufficient to proof that when we reach the `else` part, both `first` and `second` are already filled in and there were indeed two integers `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` with `i < j`.

Since `first` and `second` were initialized to $\infty$, `nums[0]` will be first assigned to `first`. There are two cases to consider. Any subsequent value `nums[j]` could be `<= first` or `> first`. If a subsequent value `nums[j] > first`, then it will be assigned to `second`. In this case, `first == nums[i] < second == nums[j]` and `i < j` and the proof is complete. In the second case, `nums[j] < first`, which means `nums[j] < second`. Hence we are free to update `first` with `nums[j]`, knowing that we have already found two numbers earlier such that `first < second`, where the index of `first` is smaller than the index of `second`. This completes the proof.

It is important to note that even though the above code correctly identifies the presence of an increasing triplet, the triplet generated by the above code may not necessarily be a correct one. This is OK as the problem is not asking us to return the triplet.

**Runtime**:  $O(n)$ as we iterate through `nums` only once.
