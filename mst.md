# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

A spanning tree is a subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that includes all the vertices of the graph.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

An MST is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.

Two popular algorithms for finding MST in a graph are:
1. Kruskal's MST Algorithm
2. Prim's MST Algorithm
