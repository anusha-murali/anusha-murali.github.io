# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

A tree is connected, acyclic, and has $|V|-1$ edges (any two implies the third).

A spanning tree is a subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that includes all the vertices of the graph.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of a **connected, edge-weighted undirected graph** that connects all the vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

An MST is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.

**Cut Property**: For any cut of a connected, undirected graph, the minimum weight edge that crosses the cut belongs to MST.

Two popular algorithms for finding MST in a graph are:
1. Kruskal's MST Algorithm
2. [Prim's MST Algorithm](./prim.md)

[Back to Greedy Algorithms](./greedy.md)
