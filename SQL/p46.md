### 46. Contest Leaderboard

---
 You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, 
 too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. 
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, 
then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.
 
The following tables contain contest data:
 
`HACKERS`: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

</p>


`SUBMISSIONS`: The submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, 
challenge_id is the id of the challenge that the submission belongs to, and score is the score of the submission.

</p>


**Sample Output**

```
4071 Rose 191
74842 Lisa 174
84072 Bonnie 100
4806 Angela 89
26071 Frank 85
80305 Kimberly 67
49438 Patrick 43
```

**Explanation**

Hacker 4071 submitted solutions for challenges 19797 and 49593, so the total score = 95 + max(43, 96) = 191.

Hacker 74842 submitted solutions for challenges 19797 and 63132, so the total score = max(98, 5) + 76 = 174.

Hacker 84072 submitted solutions for challenges 49593 and 63132, so the total score = 100 + 0 = 100.

The total scores for hackers 4806, 26071, 80305, and 49438 can be similarly calculated.
