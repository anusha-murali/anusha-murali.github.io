### 26. Weather Observation Station 11: Solution

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.


The STATION table is described as follows:

</p>

where `LAT_N` is the northern latitude and `LONG_W` is the western longitude.

We can use Oracle's `REGEXP_LIKE()` function to construct this query as follows:

```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(CITY, '^[^AEIOU]') OR REGEXP_LIKE(CITY, '[^aeiou]$');
```
