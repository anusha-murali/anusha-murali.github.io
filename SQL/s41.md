### 41. Type of Triangle: Solution

---
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

* Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
* Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
* Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
* Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

The `TRIANGLES` table is described as follows:

</p>

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

**Sample Input**

</p>

**Sample Output**

```
Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
```

**Explanation**

Values in the tuple **(20, 20, 23)**form an Isosceles triangle, because A ≡ B. Values in the tuple (20, 20, 20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A ≡ B ≡ C. 
Values in the tuple (20, 21, 22) form a Scalene triangle, because A ≠ B ≠ C. 
Values in the tuple (13, 14, 30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.

Note that there’s no `IF` keyword in SQL. If you want to do `IF-THEN-ELSE` logic in the `SELECT` clause,`WHERE` clause or anywhere else in a statement, you need a `CASE` expression.
The database processes the `CASE` expression from top-to-bottom. It returns the value for the first when clause that is true. If none are true, it returns the value in the `ELSE` clause.
We can use a `CASE` expression to construct this query as follows:

```sql
SELECT CASE
  WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
  WHEN (A + B <= C) OR
       (A + C <= B) OR
       (B + C <= A) THEN 'Not A Triangle'
  WHEN (A = B AND B != C) OR 
       (A = C AND A != B) OR
       (B = C AND B != A) THEN 'Isosceles'
  ELSE 'Scalene'
END
FROM TRIANGLES;
```
