### 45. Challenges

---
 Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
 Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
 If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

 The following tables contain contest data:
 
`HACKERS`: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

</p>


`CHALLENGES`: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, the hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the challenge.

</p>





**Sample Output**

```
21283 Angela 6
88255 Patrick 5
96196 Lisa 1
```

**Explanation**

Hacker 86870 got a score of 30 for challenge 71055 with a difficulty level of 2, so 86870 earned a full score for this challenge.

Hacker 90411 got a score of 30 for challenge 71055 with a difficulty level of 2, so 90411 earned a full score for this challenge.

Hacker 90411 got a score of 100 for challenge 66730 with a difficulty level of 6, so 90411 earned a full score for this challenge.

Only hacker 90411 managed to earn a full score for more than one challenge, so we print the their hacker_id and name as 2 space-separated values.
