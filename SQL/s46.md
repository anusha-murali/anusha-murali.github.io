### 46. Contest Leaderboard: Solution

---
 You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, 
 too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. 
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, 
then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of 0 from your result.
 
The following tables contain contest data:
 
`HACKERS`: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

</p>


`SUBMISSIONS`: The submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, 
challenge_id is the id of the challenge that the submission belongs to, and score is the score of the submission.

**Sample Output**

```
4071 Rose 191
74842 Lisa 174
84072 Bonnie 100
4806 Angela 89
26071 Frank 85
80305 Kimberly 67
49438 Patrick 43
```

**Explanation**

Hacker 4071 submitted solutions for challenges 19797 and 49593, so the total score = 95 + max(43, 96) = 191.

Hacker 74842 submitted solutions for challenges 19797 and 63132, so the total score = max(98, 5) + 76 = 174.

Hacker 84072 submitted solutions for challenges 49593 and 63132, so the total score = 100 + 0 = 100.

The total scores for hackers 4806, 26071, 80305, and 49438 can be similarly calculated.

We will build the solution to this problem gradually in three steps as follows:

**Step 1**: For each hacker, we will first find the maximum score for each of the `CHALLENGE_ID` that they participated. This can be obtained by the following query:
```
SELECT HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID, MAX(SCORE) M_SCORE
FROM SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID;
```
As indicated in the last sentence of the problem statement, we will exclude all hackers with a total score of 0. So, the above query becomes:
```
SELECT HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID, MAX(SCORE) M_SCORE
FROM SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID
HAVING MAX(SCORE) > 0;
```

**Step 2**: Now we can sum up the maximum scores received on all the challenges for each hacker as follows:
```
SELECT H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, SUM(IV.M_SCORE) SUM_SCORE
FROM HACKERS H, 
       (SELECT HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID, MAX(SCORE) M_SCORE
        FROM SUBMISSIONS
        GROUP BY HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID
        HAVING MAX(SCORE) > 0) IV
WHERE H.HACKER_ID = IV.HACKER_ID
GROUP BY H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME;
```
As can be seen, we have embedded the first query as an inline view in the above query so that we can sum up all the maximum scores for each hacker.

**Step 3**: Since the problem statement is asking as to order the results by descending score, and to also order the results by hacker_id if more than one hacker achieved the same total score, we obtain the final query as follows:
```
SELECT H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, SUM(IV.M_SCORE) SUM_SCORE
FROM HACKERS H, 
       (SELECT HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID, MAX(SCORE) M_SCORE
        FROM SUBMISSIONS
        GROUP BY HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID
        HAVING MAX(SCORE) > 0) IV
WHERE H.HACKER_ID = IV.HACKER_ID
GROUP BY H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
ORDER BY SUM_SCORE DESC, H.HACKER_ID;
```
