where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, 
and salary is their monthly salary.

</p>

**Sample Output**

```
Ashley
Julia

**Explanation**

Only Ashley, Julia, and Belvet have Marks > 75. If you look at the last three characters of each of their names, 
there are no duplicates and 'ley' < 'lia' < 'vet'.
