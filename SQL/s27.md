### 27. Weather Observation Station 12: Solution

---
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.


The STATION table is described as follows:

<p align="center">

</p>

where `LAT_N` is the northern latitude and `LONG_W` is the western longitude.

As before, we use Oracle's `REGEXP_LIKE()()` function. The only difference between the previous query and the current one is that the CITY name should neither
begin with a vowel nor end with a vowel.

```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(CITY, '^[^AEIOU]') AND REGEXP_LIKE(CITY, '[^aeiou]$');
```
