### 19. Weather Observation Station 4: Solution

---
Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

The STATION table is described as follows:

</p>

where `LAT_N` is the northern latitude and `LONG_W` is the western longitude.

For example, if there are three records in the table with CITY values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. The query returns 1, because

`total number of records - number of unique city names = 3 - 2 = 1`

`SELECT COUNT(CITY)- COUNT(DISTINCT CITY)
FROM STATION;`
