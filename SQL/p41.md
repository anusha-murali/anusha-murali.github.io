### 41. Type of Triangle

---
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

* Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
* Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
* Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
* Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

The `TRIANGLES` table is described as follows:

</p>

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

**Constraints**

$1000 < \text{Salary} < 10^5$.

**Sample Input**

<img width="171" alt="41_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfaeb8cc-e8c4-4cbe-bc1d-7f474239b295" />
</p>

**Sample Output**

```
Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
```

**Explanation**

Values in the tuple **(20, 20, 23)**form an Isosceles triangle, because A ≡ B. Values in the tuple (20, 20, 20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A ≡ B ≡ C. 
Values in the tuple (20, 21, 22) form a Scalene triangle, because A ≠ B ≠ C. 
Values in the tuple (13, 14, 30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.
