### 24. Weather Observation Station 9: Solution

---
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.


The STATION table is described as follows:

</p>

where `LAT_N` is the northern latitude and `LONG_W` is the western longitude.

We can query using `REGEXP_LIKE` as follows:

`SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE NOT REGEXP_LIKE(CITY, '^[AEIOU]');`

Instead of using `NOT` in the `WHERE` clause, we can also construct the query as follows:

`SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(CITY, '^[^AEIOU]');`

**Explanation**: `[^AEIOU]` looks for patterns that do not include the letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and `'^[^AEIOU]'` restricts the above exclusion to the first character of the string.
