### 42. The PADS

---
Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.

where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

The `OCCUPATIONS` table is described as follows:

</p>

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

**Sample Input**

</p>

**Sample Output**

```
Isosceles
Equilateral
Scalene
Not A Triangle
```

**Explanation**

Values in the tuple **(20, 20, 23)**form an Isosceles triangle, because A ≡ B. Values in the tuple (20, 20, 20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A ≡ B ≡ C. 
Values in the tuple (20, 21, 22) form a Scalene triangle, because A ≠ B ≠ C. 
Values in the tuple (13, 14, 30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.
