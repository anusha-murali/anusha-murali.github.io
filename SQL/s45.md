### 45. Challenges: Solution

---
 Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student. 
 Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. 
 If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

 The following tables contain challenge data:
 
`HACKERS`: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

</p>


`CHALLENGES`: The challenge_id is the id of the challenge, the hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the challenge.

```

**Explanation**

For Sample Case 0, we can get the following details:

<p align="center">
<img width="377" alt="45_7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c99d0372-996a-43fc-862b-6b3bec62e92a" />
</p>

Students 5077 and 62743 both created 4 challenges, but the maximum number of challenges created is 6 so these students are excluded from the result.


For Sample Case 1, we can get the following details:

<p align="center">
<img width="377" alt="45_8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bc15729-a817-4db9-8a70-d75fe505401a" />
</p>

Students 12299 and 34856 both created 6 challenges. Because 6 is the maximum number of challenges created, these students are included in the result.

We will build the solution to this problem gradually in three steps as follows:

**Step 1**: We first print the `HACKER_ID`, `NAME` and the total number of challenges created by each student, sorting the results by the total number of challenges in descending order. This is easy.

```
SELECT C.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, COUNT(C.CHALLENGE_ID) CNT
FROM HACKERS H, CHALLENGES C
WHERE H.HACKER_ID = C.HACKER_ID 
GROUP BY C.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
ORDER BY CNT DESC;
```
If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then we must sort the result by `HACKER_ID`. Hence we improve the abovee query as follows:
```
SELECT C.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, COUNT(C.CHALLENGE_ID) CNT
FROM HACKERS H, CHALLENGES C
WHERE H.HACKER_ID = C.HACKER_ID 
GROUP BY C.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
ORDER BY CNT DESC, C.HACKER_ID;
```

**Step 2** 

The last sentence of the problem needs a closer look: *If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.*

The above statement implies the following two sets of rows:
1. If the maximum number of challenges created is $N$, include all those students who created the maximum number of challenges $N$.
2. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, which is less than $N$, then exclude all those students.
 
The following query returns the maximum number of challenges created:
```
SELECT MAX(C) N
FROM (SELECT COUNT(CHALLENGE_ID) C
      FROM CHALLENGES
      GROUP BY HACKER_ID);
```
Having computed the maximum number of challenges, $N$, we will include all those students who created $N$ challenges, which corresponds to the set of rows in (1) above. 
So, our original query can be improved as follows:
```
SELECT C.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, COUNT(C.CHALLENGE_ID) CNT
FROM HACKERS H, CHALLENGES C
WHERE H.HACKER_ID = C.HACKER_ID 
GROUP BY C.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
HAVING COUNT(C.CHALLENGE_ID) = (SELECT MAX(C) 
                                FROM (SELECT COUNT(CHALLENGE_ID) C 
                                      FROM CHALLENGES
                                      GROUP BY HACKER_ID))
ORDER BY CNT DESC, C.HACKER_ID;
```

**Step 2** 

```
SELECT c.hacker_id, h.name, count(c.challenge_id) cnt 
FROM Hackers h, Challenges c 
WHERE h.hacker_id = c.hacker_id
GROUP BY c.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING count(c.challenge_id) = (SELECT MAX(CNT3) FROM (SELECT COUNT(C1.CHALLENGE_ID) CNT3 FROM CHALLENGES C1 GROUP BY C1.HACKER_ID))
OR
count(c.challenge_id) NOT IN (SELECT count(c2.challenge_id) FROM Challenges c2 GROUP BY c2.hacker_id 
            HAVING c2.hacker_id <> c.hacker_id)
ORDER BY CNT DESC, C.HACKER_ID;
```
