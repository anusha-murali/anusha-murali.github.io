### 32. Weather Observation Station 17

---
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

The STATION table is described as follows:

</p>

where `LAT_N` is the northern latitude and `LONG_W` is the western longitude.

The problem is asking as to first select those rows where `LAT_N > 38.7780` and then select the `LONG_W` which corresponds to the smallest `LAT_N` from 
those rows.

`SELECT ROUND(LONG_W, 4) FROM (SELECT * FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780 ORDER BY LAT_N) WHERE ROWNUM <= 1;`
