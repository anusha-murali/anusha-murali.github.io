### 40. The Blunder: Solution

---
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, 
  but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. 
  She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), 
  and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), 
  and round it up to the next integer.

  The `EMPLOYEES` table is described as follows:

</p>

Note: Salary is per month.

**Constraints**

$1000 < \text{Salary} < 10^5$.

**Sample Input**

</p>

**Sample Output**

```
2061
```

**Explanation**

The table below shows the salaries without zeros as they were entered by Samantha:

</p>

Samantha computes an average salary of 98.00. The actual average salary is 2159.00.

The resulting error between the two calculations is 2159.00 - 98.00 = 2061.00. Since it is equal to the integer 2061, it does not get rounded up.

We will use the following Oracle string functions to construct our query:
1. `TO_CHAR(NUM)`, which converts integer `NUM` to string.
2. `REPLACE(STR, X, Y)`, which replaces character, `X`, in string, `STR`, with character, `Y`.
3. `TO_NUMBER(STR)`, which converts string `STR` to the corresponding integer.

In order to compute the *miscalulated* average, we will first convert each `SALARY` value to string using `TO_CHAR(SALARY)`. Then we remove all `0`'s by using
`REPLACE(TO_CHAR(SALARY), '0', '')`. Finally, we convert the resulting string back to an integer using `TO_NUMBER(REPLACE(TO_CHAR(SALARY), '0', '')`. This gives us
the `SALARY` values after removing all zeros. Hence our final query is as follows:

```sql
SELECT CEIL(AVG(SALARY) - AVG(TO_NUMBER(REPLACE(TO_CHAR(SALARY), '0', ''))))
FROM EMPLOYEES;
```
