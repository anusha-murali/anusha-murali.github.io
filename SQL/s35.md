---
 A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. 
 Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4 decimal places.

The STATION table is described as follows:

where `LAT_N` is the northern latitude and `LONG_W` is the western longitude.

We can use the `MEDIAN()` function in Oracle to compute the median of `LAT_N` as follows:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(MEDIAN(LAT_N), 4)
FROM STATION;
```
