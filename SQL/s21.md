### 21. Weather Observation Station 6: Solution

---
Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

The STATION table is described as follows:

</p>

where `LAT_N` is the northern latitude and `LONG_W` is the western longitude.

```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');
```

We could also use Oracle's `REGEXP_LIKE()` function as follows:

```
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE (CITY, '^[AEIOU]');
```
