### Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

***

Given an array $A$ of $n$ numbers, find the longest, strictly increasing subsequence of $A$.

> **Example**: $A = [2, 17, 3, 20, 1, 11, 9, 5, 6, 78, 11]$. The longest, strictly increasing subsequence of $A$ is $[2, 3, 5, 6, 11]$ and its length is 5.


Let DP$[i]$ be the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends $A[i]$.

For the above example array $A$, the DP array will be as follows:

$A$ = [2, 17, 3, 20, 1, 11, 9, 5, 6, 78, 11]

DP = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]
