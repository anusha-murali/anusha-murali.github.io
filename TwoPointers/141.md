### Squares of a Sorted Array

This simple LeetCode problem (Problem #141) demonstrates the power of two pointers to reduce runtime.

**Problem**: 

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following 
the next pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. 
Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

> Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1

> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

> Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0

> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node (0-indexed).

> Input: head = [1], pos = -1

> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

**Solution**

We can solve this problem easily using a variation of the two-pointers technique, where the second pointer advances faster than the first pointer. We can let the first pointer move 1-index at a time, while the second pointer move 2-indices at a time. 

If there is no cycle, the next pointer of the last node will be "None" and the `while` loop will terminate.

If there is a cycle, at some point during the looping, the faster pointer will be at the node, whose `next` pointer will be pointing to the node currently indexed by the slower pointer.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

def hasCycle(head: Optional[ListNode]):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```

**Runtime**: Since the `for` loop is iterating $n$ times, the runtime is $O(n)$. The space complexity is also $O(n)$, as we are using
a list of size $n$ to store the squares.
