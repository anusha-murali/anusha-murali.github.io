### Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

**Problem**: 

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the $i$-th day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future 
to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

> **Example 1**:
>
> Input: `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5. Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.


**Runtime**: Since the pointers `left` and `right` move towards each other, the number of iterations is $n$, so the runtime is $O(n)$. The only local variable being used is `maxArea`, so the space complexity is $O(1)$.
