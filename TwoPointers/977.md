### Squares of a Sorted Array

This is an elegant LeetCode problem (Problem # 977), which demonstrates the power of two pointers to reduce runtime.

**Problem**: 

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in 
non-decreasing order.

> **Example 1**:
>
> Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
> 
> Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
> 
> Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].


> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
> 
> Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

**Runtime**: Since the `for` loop is iterating $n$ times, the runtime is $O(n)$. The space complexity is also $O(n)$, as we are using
a list of size $n$ to store the squares.
