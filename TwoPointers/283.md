### Move Zeroes

This is an elegant problem from LeetCode (Problem #283)

**Problem**: Given an integer array `nums`, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order 
of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this ***in-place*** without making a copy of the array.

 

> ***Example 1***:
> 
> Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
> 
> Output: [1,3,12,0,0]


> ***Example 2***:
> 
> Input: nums = [0]
> 
> Output: [0]

**Runtime**: Ignoring the cost of eliminating numbers that are $> k$ and the cost of sorting, we see that the left and right pointers are always moving towards each other. The total number of iterations within the `while` loop is therefore $n$, and the time complexity is $O(n)$. Since we are only using one local variable `count`, the space complexity is $O(1)$.
