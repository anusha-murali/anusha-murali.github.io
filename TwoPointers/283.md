### Move Zeroes

This is an elegant problem from LeetCode (Problem #283)

**Problem**: Given an integer array `nums`, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order 
of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this ***in-place*** without making a copy of the array.

 

> ***Example 1***:
> 
> Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
> 
> Output: [1,3,12,0,0]


> ***Example 2***:
> 
> Input: nums = [0]
> 
> Output: [0]

**Solution**

Once all the zeroes are moved to the end of the list, all the ***non-zero*** integers of the original list will be on the left of the list in the same order in which they appeared initially. 

We use two pointers, `left` and `right` in the following way: The `left` pointer will point to the index where the next non-zero element needs to be placed, and the `right` pointer will be iterating through the list, starting from index 0.

```python
    def moveZeroes(nums):
        left = 0
        right = 0
        while right < len(nums):
            if nums[right] != 0:
                nums[right], nums[left] = nums[left], nums[right]
                left += 1
            right += 1
```

**Runtime**: Ignoring the cost of eliminating numbers that are $> k$ and the cost of sorting, we see that the left and right pointers are always moving towards each other. The total number of iterations within the `while` loop is therefore $n$, and the time complexity is $O(n)$. Since we are only using one local variable `count`, the space complexity is $O(1)$.
