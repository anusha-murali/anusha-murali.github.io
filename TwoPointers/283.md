### Move Zeroes

This is an elegant problem from LeetCode (Problem #283)

**Problem**: Given an integer array `nums`, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order 
of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this ***in-place*** without making a copy of the array.

 

> ***Example 1***:
> 
> Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
> 
> Output: [1,3,12,0,0]


> ***Example 2***:
> 
> Input: nums = [0]
> 
> Output: [0]

**Solution**

Once all the zeroes are moved to the end of the list, all the ***non-zero*** integers of the original list will be on the left of the list in the same order in which they appeared initially. 

We use two pointers, `left` and `right` in the following way: The `left` pointer will point to the index where the next non-zero element needs to be placed, and the `right` pointer will be iterating through the list, starting from index 0.

```python
    def moveZeroes(nums):
        left = 0
        right = 0
        while right < len(nums):
            if nums[right] != 0:
                nums[right], nums[left] = nums[left], nums[right]
                left += 1
            right += 1
```

The above algorithm can be easily understood with a simple example shown below. 

Let `nums = [2, 0, 7, 1]`. Initially the `left` (L) and the `right` (R) pointers are both at index 0.

</p>

Since `nums[right] = nums[0]` $=2\neq0$, we swap `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` (of course, they are the same elements) and increment `left` and `right` to 1.

</p>

Now `nums[right] = nums[1] = 0`, so we will **not** increment the `left` pointer, but will increment the `right` pointer. The `left` (L) and the `right` (R) pointers are therefore as shown below (i.e: `left = 1`, `right = 2`.

</p>

Now `nums[right] = nums[2] = 7` $\neq 0$, so we will swap `nums[right]` and `nums[left]` and increment both pointers. So, `left = 2` and `right = 3`.

<p align="center">
<img width="100" alt="movesZeroes_4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef8e982e-728a-4ceb-9b47-837b938b5b80" />
</p>

Now `nums[right] = nums[3] = 1` $\neq 0$, so we will swap `nums[right]` and `nums[left]` and increment both pointers. So, `left = 3` and `right = 4`.

</p>

Since `right` = 4 = `len(nums)`, the `while` loop stops, and we see that all the zeroes (there is only one in this example) have been moved to the end of the list, while the order of all the non-zero integers has been preserved.

**Runtime**: Ignoring the cost of eliminating numbers that are $> k$ and the cost of sorting, we see that the left and right pointers are always moving towards each other. The total number of iterations within the `while` loop is therefore $n$, and the time complexity is $O(n)$. Since we are only using one local variable `count`, the space complexity is $O(1)$.
