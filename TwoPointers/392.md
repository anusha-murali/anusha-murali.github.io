### Is Subsequence?

**Problem**: 

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

> Output: true

> ***Example 2***:
>
> Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
> 
> Output: false


**Solution**

This is an easy character matching problem that can be solved using two pointers.

We use the first pointer, `sp` to iterate through the string `s`.

We use the second pointer, `tp` to iterate through the string `t`.

```python
def isSubsequence(s, t):
    sp = tp = 0

    while sp < len(s) and tp < len(t):
        if s[sp] == t[tp]:
            sp += 1
        tp += 1

    return sp == len(s)
```

When we exit the `while` loop, if `sp` is equal to the length of `s`, then we have successfully matched all the characters of `s` in `t` in the same order of their appearance in `s`.

**Runtime**: Runtime is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the longer string. The space complexity is $O(1)$.
