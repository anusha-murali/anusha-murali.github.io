### Container with Most Water

**Problem**: 

You are given an integer array height of length $n$. There are $n$ vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints 
of the $i$-th line are $(i, 0)$ and $(i, \text{height}[i])$.

Find two lines that together with the $x$-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]; Output: 49

Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

***Example 2***:

Input: height = [1,1]; Output: 1

**Solution**

This problem is naturally amenable to the standard two-pointer solution, where we maintain a ***left*** and a **right** pointers, and move them towards each other - so as to maximize the area between the pointers.

Initially `maxArea = 0`, `left = 0` and `right = len(height) - 1`. 

We want to find the maximum value for `maxArea`. The current area is always `min(height[left], height[right])*(right -left)`.

***The question is which pointer should be moved first? Left or right?*** 

Since we are trying to maximize the area, we want to keep the larger of the two heights and move the pointer corresponding to the smaller height.

For example, in Example 1, initially, `left = 0` and `right = 8`. So, `maxArea = min(height[left], height[right])*(right -left) = min(1, 7)*8 = 8`. For the next iteration, we will move the pointer corresponding to the smaller height, which, in this case, is `left`. 

So, `left = 1` now. So, we compute `min(height[left], height[right])*(right -left) = min(8, 7)*7 = 49`. Since 49 is greater than the previous `maxArea`, we update `maxArea`, so that `maxArea = 49`. 

In this manner, we continue until the `left` and `right` pointers meet.

```python
def maxArea(height):
    maxArea = 0
    left = 0
    right = len(height) - 1

    while left < right:
        maxArea = max(maxArea, (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right]))

        if height[left] < height[right]:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1

    return maxArea
```

**Runtime**: Since the pointers `left` and `right` move towards each other, the number of iterations is $n$, so the runtime is $O(n)$. The only local variable being used is `maxArea`, so the space complexity is $O(1)$.
