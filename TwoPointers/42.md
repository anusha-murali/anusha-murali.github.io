### Trapping Rain Water

This simple LeetCode problem (Problem #42) demonstrates the power of two pointers to reduce runtime.

**Problem**: 

Given $n$ non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

> **Example 1**:
>
> Input: `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
> In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: `height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`
>
> Output: 9

**Runtime**: Runtime is $O(n)$ and the space complexity is $O(n)$ (as we are creating a list of size $n$).
