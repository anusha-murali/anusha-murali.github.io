### Trapping Rain Water

This simple LeetCode problem (Problem #42) demonstrates the power of two pointers to reduce runtime.

**Problem**: 

Given $n$ non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 
compute how much water it can trap after raining.

> 
> Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1].
> In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

> Input: `height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`

> Output: 9

**Solution**

We use two pointers, namely `left` and `right`, which will move towards each other from both ends. We also maintain two auxilliary pointers `leftMax` and `rightMax`, which will maintain the largest heights encountered so far from the left end and the right end.

Let us say that the `left` pointer was incremented by 1. Then, the water gain at this step is equal to `(leftMax - height(current))`, where `current` is the current index of the `left` pointer.

In a similar manner, when the `right` pointer is decremented by 1, the water gain will be `(rightMax - height(current))`, where `current` is the current index of the `right` pointer.

We will illustrate the idea using Example 2 above.

Step 1: `left` = 0, `right` = 5, `leftMax = 4`, `rightMax = 5`.

Step 2: Since `leftMax = 4` < `rightMax = 5`, we increment `left` from 0 to 1.

Step 3: Since `height[1] = 2 < leftMax`, we don't update `leftMax`. We update `water`, so `water = 0 + (leftMax - height[1]) = 0 + (4 - 2) = 2`.

Step 4: Still `leftMax = 4` < `rightMax = 5`, so we increment `left` from 1 to 2.

Step 5: Since `height[2] = 0 < leftMax`, we don't update `leftMax`. We update `water`, so `water = 2 + (leftMax - height[2]) = 2 + (4 - 0) = 6`.

Step 6: Still `leftMax = 4` < `rightMax = 5`, so we increment `left` from 2 to 3.

Step 7: Since `height[3] = 3 < leftMax`, we don't update `leftMax`. We update `water`, so `water = 6 + (leftMax - height[3]) = 6 + (4 - 3) = 7`.

Step 8: Still `leftMax = 4` < `rightMax = 5`, so we increment `left` from 3 to 4.

Step 9: Since `height[4] = 2 < leftMax`, we don't update `leftMax`. We update `water`, so `water = 7+ (leftMax - height[4]) = 7 + (4 - 2) = 9`.

Step 10: Step 8: Still `leftMax = 4` < `rightMax = 5`, so we increment `left` from 4 to 5.

Step 11: Since `height[5] = 5 = leftMax = rightMax`, we don't update either. We update `water`, so `water = 9+ (leftMax - height[5]) = 7 + (5 - 5) = 9`.

Since `left == right`, the `while` loop terminates at this point, and we return `9`.

```python
     def trap(height):
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        leftMax = height[left]
        rightMax = height[right]
        water = 0

        while left < right:
            if leftMax < rightMax:
                left += 1
                if height[left] > leftMax:
                    leftMax = height[left]
                water += (leftMax - height[left])
            else:
                right -= 1
                if height[right] > rightMax:
                    rightMax = height[right]
                water += (rightMax -height[right])
        return water
```



**Runtime**: Runtime is $O(n)$ and the space complexity is $O(n)$ (as we are creating a list of size $n$).
