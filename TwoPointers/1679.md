### Maximum Number of $k$-sum Pairs

**Problem**: You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer $k$.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals $k$ and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

***Example 1***:

Input:   `nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5`; Output: 2

Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
- 
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

***Example 2***:

Input: `nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6`; Output: 1

Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.
