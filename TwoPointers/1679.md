### Maximum Number of $k$-sum Pairs

**Problem**: You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer $k$.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals $k$ and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

***Example 1***:

Input:   `nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5`; Output: 2

Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
- 
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

***Example 2***:

Input: `nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6`; Output: 1

Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

**Solution**

This problem is amenable to the standard two-pointers solution, provided we fist sort the list, `nums`. The following Python code is self-explantory.

```python
   def maxOperations(nums, k):
        nums = [x for x in nums if x < k] # Remove numbers > k
        nums.sort()
        left = 0
        right = len(nums)-1
        count = 0
        while left < right:
            if nums[left] + nums[right] == k:
                count += 1
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            elif nums[left] + nums[right] > k:
                right -= 1
            else:
                left += 1     
        return count
```

**Runtime**: Ignoring the cost of eliminating numbers that are $> k$ and the cost of sorting, we see that the left and right pointers are always moving towards each other. The total number of iterations within the `while` loop is therefore $n$, and the time complexity is $O(n)$. Since we are only using one local variable `count`, the space complexity is $O(1)$.
