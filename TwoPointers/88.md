### Merge Sorted Array

In this LeetCode problem (Problem #88), we use three pointers to arrive at an efficient solution.

**Problem**: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two 
integers $m$ and $n$, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. 
To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of $m + n$, where the first $m$ elements denote the elements that 
should be merged, and the last $n$ elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of $n$.

 

> **Example 1**:
>
> Input: `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3`
>
> Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
> 
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[1,2,3]` and `[2,5,6]`.
The result of the merge is `[1,2,2,3,5,6]` with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: `nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0`
> 
> Output: [1]
> 
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[1]` and `[]`.
The result of the merge is [1].

> **Example 3**:
> 
> Input: `nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1`
> 
> Output: `[1]`
> 
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[]` and `[1]`.
The result of the merge is `[1]`.
Note that because `m = 0`, there are no elements in `nums1`. The `0` is only there to ensure the merge result can
fit in `nums1`.


**Solution**

We will use three pointers, namely `firstPtr`, which points to the last element of `nums1`, `secondPtr`, which points to the last element of `nums2`, and `thirdPtr`, which points to the last ***index** of `nums1`. Note that the length of `nums1` is equal to the actual number of elements in `nums1` ($m$) and the number of elements in `nums2` ($n$).

```python
   def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        firstPtr = m - 1
        secondPtr = n -1
        thirdPtr = m + n - 1
        while firstPtr >= 0 and secondPtr >= 0:
            if nums1[firstPtr] > nums2[secondPtr]:
                nums1[thirdPtr] = nums1[firstPtr]
                firstPtr -= 1
            else:
                nums1[thirdPtr] = nums2[secondPtr]
                secondPtr -= 1
            thirdPtr -= 1
```


The code is self-explantory. If a `nums1` element is greater than the `nums2` element being compared, then we copy the `nums1` element to the index pointed to by `thirdPtr` and decrement both the `firstPtr` and the `thirdPtr`. Otherwise, we decrement both the `secondPtr` and the `thirdPtr`.

Finally, we copy any remaining `nums2` elements to the remaining spaces of `nums1`.


**Runtime**: Since the `while` loop executes only $n+m$ times, the runtime is $O(n+m)$. As we are not using any additional storage, the space complexity is $O(1)$.
