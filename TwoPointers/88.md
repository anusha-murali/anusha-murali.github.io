### Merge Sorted Array

In this LeetCode problem (Problem #88), we use three pointers to arrive at an efficient solution.

**Problem**: You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two 
integers $m$ and $n$, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. 
To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of $m + n$, where the first $m$ elements denote the elements that 
should be merged, and the last $n$ elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. `nums2` has a length of $n$.

 

> **Example 1**:
>
> Input: `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3`
>
> Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
> 
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[1,2,3]` and `[2,5,6]`.
The result of the merge is `[1,2,2,3,5,6]` with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: `nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0`
> 
> Output: [1]
> 
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[1]` and `[]`.
The result of the merge is [1].

> **Example 3**:
> 
> Input: `nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1`
> 
> Output: `[1]`
> 
> Explanation: The arrays we are merging are `[]` and `[1]`.
The result of the merge is `[1]`.
Note that because `m = 0`, there are no elements in `nums1`. The `0` is only there to ensure the merge result can
fit in `nums1`.


**Runtime**: Since the pointers `left` and `right` move towards each other, the number of iterations is $n$, so the runtime is $O(n)$. The only local variable being used is `maxArea`, so the space complexity is $O(1)$.
