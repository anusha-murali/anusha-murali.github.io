# Approximation Algorithms

## Minimum Vertex Cover

Let $G = (V,E)$. The minimum vertex cover is the minimum sized set of vertices that every edge has an endpoint in it (the edge is therefore **covered**).

## Maximum Independent Set

Let $G = (V, E)$ a graph. An independent set $V'$ is a subset of $V$ such that no edge connects two vertices in $V'$.
