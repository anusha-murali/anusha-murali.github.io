### Maximum Ice Cream Bars

**Problem**:

It is a sweltering summer day, and a boy wants to buy some ice cream bars.

At the store, there are n ice cream bars. You are given an array costs of length n, where costs[i] is the price of the ith ice cream bar in coins. The boy initially has *coins* coins to spend, and he wants to buy as many ice cream bars as possible. 

Note: The boy can buy the ice cream bars in any order.

Return the maximum number of ice cream bars the boy can buy with *coins* coins.

You must solve the problem by counting sort.


**Solution**

In order for the boy to buy as many ice cream bars as possible, he needs to buy ice cream bars starting with the smallest price. So, we need to sort the cost array, then keep a count of how many ice cream bars the boy is able to buy with *coins* coins. 

'''python

class Solution:
    def maxIceCream(self, costs: List[int], coins: int) -> int:
        sorted_costs = sorted(costs)
        sum_costs = 0 
        i = 0 
        while i < len(sorted_costs) and sum_costs <= coins:
            sum_costs += sorted_costs[i]
            i += 1
        if sum_costs > coins: 
            return i - 1
        return i
