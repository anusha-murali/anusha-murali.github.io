# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm finds the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph. Following is the description of the algorithm.

1. Mark all vertices as *unvisited*. Also initialize the distance of each vertex from the source vertex to $\infity$, but initialize this distance to 0 for the source vertex.
2. When at a given vertex, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their distances *through the current vertex*. Compare the newly calculated distance to the current value and update it if the newly calculated distance is smaller.
3.
