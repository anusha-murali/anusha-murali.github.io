# Hashing

### 1. The Birthday Paradox

Assuming birthdays are distributed uniformly at random across the 365 days of the year, how many people do there need to be in a room before there is a > 50% chance that two of them have the same birthday?

The probability the first two people have different birthdays is $(1âˆ’\frac{1}{365})$. So, the probability that all of the first $k$ people have different birthdays is,

<!--
```math
\left(1 - \frac{1}{365} \right)\left(1 - \frac{2}{365} \right) \cdots  \left(1 - \frac{k-1}{365} \right)
```
-->

$$
\left(1 - \frac{1}{365} \right)\left(1 - \frac{2}{365} \right) \cdots  \left(1 - \frac{k-1}{365} \right)
$$

For $k=23$, this probability crosses over 49.3%. So, if there are at least 23 people in the room, the probability that two of them will have the same birthday is > 50%.

### 2. Balls into Bins

The birthday paradox is often formulated in terms of balls and bins. 

Consider $n$ balls that are randomly thrown into $m$ bins. 

#### Collision Probability

The probability that all of the $n$ balls land in different bins, given that $n < m$ is,

$$
\left(1 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \left(1 - \frac{2}{m}\right) \cdots \left(1 - \frac{n-1}{m}\right) \leq \text{exp}\left ( -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}i \right) \leq \text{exp}(-\Omega(n^2/m))
$$

#### Number of Empty Bins

For the first bin to be empty, it has to be missed by all $n$ balls. Since each ball hits the first bin with probability $\frac{1}{m}$, the probability that the first bin remains empty is,

$$
\left(1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^n \approx e^{-n/m}.
$$

Since the same argument holds for all bins, on average an $e^{-n/m}$ fraction of the bins will remain empty.

### 3. Hash Functions

A hash function, $H(x)$ is a deterministic mapping from one set (balls) to another set (bins) that appears random across different elements of the first set (balls).

Let $A$ be an array of $m$ bits representing a set $S=\\{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \\}$ of $n$ elements. We will turn on the bit corresponding to the index returned by $h(x_i)$, indicating that the element $x_i$ is present in the set. Therefore, if $x_i \in S$, then $A[h(x_i)] = 1$.

False positives can occur. It is possible that for some $x_j \not \in S$, it may be that $A[h(x_j)] =1$.

False positive probability = $1 - e^{-n/m}$.

### 4. Hashing and Passwords

To protect against hackers, computer systems prefer that users don't use dictionary words as passwords. The probability of rejecting a password that should be accepted is the same as the probability that the first bin is not empty in the balls and bins analysis, which is $1-e^{-n/m}$. 

For example, with $n/m = 0.5$, this false positive probability is $\approx 0.4$, which is very high! So, we need $m$ to be very large or alternative solutions such as the following:

* Hashing with chaining
* Hashing with linear probing
* Bloom Filters


# Bloom Filters

1. A Bloom filter is an array $A$ of $m$ bits representing a set $S=\\{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \\}$ of $n$ elements. All entries in $A = 0$ initially.
2. $k$ independent hash functions, $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_k$ with range $\\{1, 2, \ldots, m\\}$.
3. For eacch $x_i \in S$, the bit $h_j(x_i)$ in the array $A$ is set to 1, for $1 \leq j \leq k$.

**An Example**

$$
\\begin{array}{|c|c|} \\hline
0 & 0 \\\\ \\hline
\\end{array}
$$
