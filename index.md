### 1. The Birthday Paradox

Assuming birthdays are distributed uniformly at random across the 365 days of the year, how many people do there need to be in a room before there is a > 50% chance that two of them have the same birthday?

The probability the first two people have different birthdays is $(1âˆ’\frac{1}{365})$. So, the probability that all of the first $k$ people have different birthdays is,

<!--
```math
\left(1 - \frac{1}{365} \right)\left(1 - \frac{2}{365} \right) \cdots  \left(1 - \frac{k-1}{365} \right)
```
-->

$$
\left(1 - \frac{1}{365} \right)\left(1 - \frac{2}{365} \right) \cdots  \left(1 - \frac{k-1}{365} \right)
$$

For $k=23$, this probability crosses over 49.3%. So, if there are at least 23 people in the room, the probability that two of them will have the same birthday is > 50%.
