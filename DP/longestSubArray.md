### Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

This is a beautiful LeetCode problem (Problem #1493).

**Problem**: Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. 
Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

Example 1:

Input: `nums = [1, 1, 0, 1]`; Output: 3;

Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, `[1,1,1]` contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.

Example 2:

Input: `nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]`; Output: 5

Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, `[0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1]` longest subarray with value of 1's is `[1,1,1,1,1]`.

Example 3:

Input: `nums = [1,1,1]`; Output: 2

Explanation: You must delete 1 element.
