### Maximum Repeating Substring

This is an easy problem from LeetCode (Problem #1668), which demonstrates the power of dynamic programming.

**Problem**

For a string sequence, a string word is $k$-repeating if word concatenated $k$ times is a substring of sequence. 
The word's maximum $k$-repeating value is the highest value $k$ where word is $k$-repeating in sequence. If word is not a 
substring of sequence, word's maximum $k$-repeating value is 0.

Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum $k$-repeating value of word in sequence.

 
> **Example 1**:
>
> Input: `sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"`
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation: `"abab"` is a substring in `"ababc"`.


> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: `sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"`
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation: `"ba"` is a substring in `"ababc"`. `"baba"` is not a substring in `"ababc"`.


> **Example 3**:
>
> Input: `sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"`
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: `"ac"` is not a substring in `"ababc"`. 


**Solution**

We will use an array named `dp` of length `len(sequence) + 1`, where `dp[i]` denotes the maximum number of consecutive occurrence of `word` upto index `i` in `sequence` (i.e: the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `word` that ended at index `i-1`).

If there are `dp[i]` number of consecutive `words` that end at index `i-1`, if `word` occurs again at index `i`, then we have discovered one more consecutive occurrence of `word`. This means, we will need to update `dp[i + len(word)]` to `dp[i] + 1`.

Alternatively, if we have just discovered the occurrence of `word` ending at index `i-1`, then `dp[i] = dp[i-len(word)] + 1`.

We initialize all the elements of `dp` to 0 at the beginning. 

```python
    def maxRepeating(sequence: str, word: str):
        dp=[0]*(len(sequence)+1)
        for i in range(len(word), len(sequence)+1):
            if word==sequence[i-len(word):i]:
                dp[i]=dp[i-len(word)]+1
        return max(dp)
```

We return the maximum value in the `dp` array as it denotes the maximum-consecutive occurrances of `word` in `sequence`.

Consider the following example: `sequence = "ababcababab"` and `word = "ab"`.

At the end of the call to `maxRepeating(sequence, word)`, the `dp[]` array will contain the following entries:

</p>

For the above example, the loop index $i$ starts at `len(word) = 2` and ends at `len(sequence) = 11`. Let us follow each iteration in the `for` loop of the above algorithm:

$i = 2$: Since `word = sequence[0:2]`, we set `dp[2] = dp[i-len(word)] + 1 = dp[0] + 1 = 1`.

$i = 3$: Since `word` $\neq$ `sequence[1:3]`, we don't update `dp[3]` (it remains at 0).

$i = 4$: Since `word = sequence[2:4]`, we set `dp[4] = dp[i-len(word)] + 1 = dp[2] + 1 = 2`.

$i = 5$: Since `word` $\neq$ `sequence[3:5]`, we don't update `dp[5]` (it remains at 0).

$i = 6$: Since `word` $\neq$ `sequence[4:6]`, we don't update `dp[6]` (it remains at 0).

$i = 7$: Since `word = sequence[5:7]`, we set `dp[7] = dp[i-len(word)] + 1 = dp[5] + 1 = 1`.

$i = 8$: Since `word` $\neq$ `sequence[6:8]`, we don't update `dp[8]` (it remains at 0).

$i = 9$: Since `word = sequence[7:9]`, we set `dp[9] = dp[i-len(word)] + 1 = dp[7] + 1 = 2`.

$i = 10$: Since `word` $\neq$ `sequence[8:10]`, we don't update `dp[10]` (it remains at 0).

$i = 11$: Since `word = sequence[9:11]`, we set `dp[11] = dp[i-len(word)] + 1 = dp[9] + 1 = 3`.

Now, we exit out of the `for` loop and return `max(dp)`, which is 3.


Consider another example: `sequence = "aaabaaaabaaabaaaabaaaabaaaabaaaaba"` and `word = "aaaba"`.

At the end of the call to `maxRepeating(sequence, word)`, the `dp[]` array will contain the following entries:

> `dp = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]`

Since `max(dp) = 5`, there are 5 consecutive occurrance of `"aaaba"` in `"aaabaaaabaaabaaaabaaaabaaaabaaaaba"`.

**Runtime**: Since we are iterating through the loop only once, the runtime is $O(n)$. Due to the use of `dp` array, the space complexity is $O(n)$.
