### Longest String of Consecutive Ones

**Problem**: Consider an array consisting of only 1's and 0's. You are allowed to substitute a maximum of $k$ 0's with 1's. Find the length of the longest consecutive 1's that is feasible.

**Runtime**: The total number of additions and multiplications done by the two `for` loops result in a runtime of $O(n^2)$.
