### Longest String of Consecutive Ones

**Problem**: Consider an array consisting of only 1's and 0's. You are allowed to substitute a maximum of $k$ 0's with 1's. Find the length of the longest consecutive 1's that is feasible.

*Example*: $A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0] \text{ and } k = 2$.


*Answer*: 6.

The longest consecutive 1's for the above example is $A = [1,1,1,0,0,\textcolor{red}{1},1,1,1,1,\textcolor{red}{1}] $





**Runtime**: The total number of additions and multiplications done by the two `for` loops result in a runtime of $O(n^2)$.
