# Linear Programming



Linear programs, in general, have the following form: there is a objective function that one seeks to maximize or minimize, along with constraints on the variables. The objective function and the constraints are all linear in the variables; that is, all equations have no higher powers of the variables, nor are the variables multiplied together.
