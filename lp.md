# Linear Programming


Many of the problems for which we want algorithms are optimization tasks: the shortest path, the cheapest spanning tree, the longest increasing subsequence, and so on. In such cases, we seek a solution that,
  1. satisfies certain constraints (for instance, the path must use edges of the graph and lead from $s$ to $t$, the tree must touch all nodes, the subsequence must be increasing); and,
  2. is the best possible, with respect to some well-defined criterion, among all solutions that satisfy these constraints.


Linear programs, in general, have the following form: there is a objective function that one seeks to maximize or minimize, along with constraints on the variables. The objective function and the constraints are all linear in the variables; that is, all equations have no higher powers of the variables, nor are the variables multiplied together.
