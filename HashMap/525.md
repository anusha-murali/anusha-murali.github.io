### Contiguous Array

This is a nice problem from LeetCode (Problem #525). 

**Problem**: Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal 
number of 0 and 1.

> **Example 1**:
> 
> Input: nums = [0,1]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
>
> **Example 2**:
> 
> Input: nums = [0,1,0]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
>
> **Example 3**:
>
> Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,0] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Runtime**: The cost of building the hash map is $O(n)$ and the cost of finding the pair that sums to `target` is also $O(n)$. Hence the runtime is $O(n)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$ due to the need for the hash map.
