### Contiguous Array

This is a nice problem from LeetCode (Problem #525). 

**Problem**: Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal 
number of 0 and 1.

> **Example 1**:
> 
> Input: nums = [0,1]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.
>
> **Example 2**:
> 
> Input: nums = [0,1,0]
>
> Output: 2
>
> Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.
>
> **Example 3**:
>
> Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
>
> Output: 6
>
> Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,0] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Solution 1 Naive Brute Force Approach**

The naive and brute force approach examines every subarray of `nums`, using two `for` loops. The outer `for` loop tracks the start of the subarray and the inner `for` loop tracks the end of the subarray. When the count of zeroes and ones in the subarray are equal, we update `maxLen` if the current length is larger than the current `maxLen`. Upon exiting the loops, `maxLen` is guaranteed to be equal to the largest contiguous array with equal number of zeroes and ones.

```python
    def findMaxLength(nums):
        maxLen = 0
        for start in range(len(nums)):
            zeroes = ones = 0
            for end in range(start, len(nums)):
                if nums[end] == 0:
                    zeroes += 1
                else:
                    ones += 1
                if zeroes == ones:
                    maxLen = max(maxLen, end - start + 1)
        return maxLen
```

**Runtime** The time complexity is obviously $O(n^2$ due to the doubly nested `for` loops. The space complexity is $O(1)$ as we are only using constant variables (`zeroes, ones, maxLen`).

**Solution 2 Hash Map Approach**

```python
    def findMaxLength(nums):
        from collections import defaultdict
        count = maxLen = 0
        d = defaultdict(int)
        d[0] = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                count -= 1
            else:
                count += 1
            if count in d:
                maxLen = max(maxLen, i+1 - d[count])
            else:
                d[count] = i+1
        return maxLen
```


**Runtime**: The cost of building the hash map is $O(n)$ and the cost of finding the pair that sums to `target` is also $O(n)$. Hence the runtime is $O(n)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$ due to the need for the hash map.
