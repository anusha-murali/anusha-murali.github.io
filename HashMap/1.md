### Two Sum

This is a nice problem from LeetCode (Problem #1). This is also one of the most frequently asked questions in interviews.

**Problem**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that 
they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

> **Example 1**:
> 
> Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`
> 
> Output: `[0,1]`
> 
> Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.
> 
> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`
> 
> Output: `[1,2]`
> 
> **Example 3**:
>
> Input: `nums = [3,3], target = 6`
> 
> Output: `[0,1]`

**Solution 1**


**Runtime**: Since the `for` loop iterates through the number of rows in the transposed matrix, the runtime is $O(n)$.
