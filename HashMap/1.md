### Two Sum

This is a nice problem from LeetCode (Problem #1). This is also one of the most frequently asked questions in interviews.

**Problem**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that 
they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

> **Example 1**:
> 
> Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`
> 
> Output: `[0,1]`
> 
> Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.
> 
> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`
> 
> Output: `[1,2]`
> 
> **Example 3**:
>
> Input: `nums = [3,3], target = 6`
> 
> Output: `[0,1]`

**Solution 1**

An obvious and naive solution is to have two `for` loops, the first one pointing to the first number and the second one pointing to the second number. Whenever the first and second number add upto the `target`, we return their indices.

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
```

**Runtime**: Due to the nested `for` loops, the runtime of this naive solution is $O(n^2)$. 

**Solution 2**

We can actually construct an $O(n)$ solution using a hash-map. In Python, hash-maps are constructed using dictionaries.

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    hashMap = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        hashMap[nums[i]] = i

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        secondNum = target - nums[i]
        if secondNum in hashMap and hashMap[secondNum] != i:
            return i, hashMap[secondNum]
```

***Note***: In the case of an integer appearing twice in `nums`, the index of the second occurrence overwrites the first index in the dictionary. Do we need the first index also in our dictionary? No. This is because the first index is pointed to by `i`, and the second index is correctly pointed to by `hashMap[secondNum]`. Please see Example 3 above.

**Runtime**: The cost of building the hash map is $O(n)$ and the cost of finding the pair that sums to `target` is also $O(n)$. Hence the runtime is $O(n)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$ due to the need for the hash map.
