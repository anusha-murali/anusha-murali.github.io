### Two Sum

This is a nice problem from LeetCode (Problem #1). This is also one of the most frequently asked questions in interviews.

**Problem**: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that 
they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

> **Example 1**:
> 
> Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9`
> 
> Output: `[0,1]`
> 
> Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.
> 
> **Example 2**:
>
> Input: `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`
> 
> Output: `[1,2]`
> 
> **Example 3**:
>
> Input: `nums = [3,3], target = 6`
> 
> Output: `[0,1]`

**Solution 1**

An obvious and naive solution is to have two `for` loops, the first one pointing to the first number and the second one pointing to the second number. Whenever the first and second number add upto the `target`, we return their indices.

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
```

**Runtime**: Due to the nested `for` loops, the runtime of this naive solution is $O(n^2)$. 

**Solution 2**

We can actually construct an $O(n)$ solution using a hash-map. In Python, hash-maps are constructed using dictionaries.

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    hashMap = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        hashMap[nums[i]] = i

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        secondNum = target - nums[i]
        if secondNum in hashMap and hashMap[secondNum] != i:
            return i, hashMap[secondNum]
```

***Note***: In the case of an integer appearing twice in `nums`, the index of the second occurrence overwrites the first index in the dictionary. Do we need the first index also in our dictionary? No. This is because the first index is pointed to by `i`, and the second index is correctly pointed to by `hashMap[secondNum]`, so we have indexes of both integers that sum up to `target`. Please see Example 3 above.

**Solution 3**

Can we further improve Solution 2? Yes, we can - by making the following clever observation.

We don't need to build the full hash map at the beginning. We initialize an empty hash map. Let's say we are currently at element, `nums[i]` while iterating through the `for` loop. So, the second number that will sum up to the given target is `secondNum = target - nums[i]`. We check if `secondNum` is present in the hash map. If not, we add it to the hash map (as `secondNum` can sum up to another number further down in the `for` loop). We repeat the process until we find a matching number in the hash map.

The above idea helps avoid the need to build a hash map for all the elements in `nums`, thus saving on the space.

Following is the solution:

```python
    def twoSum(nums, target):
        hashMap = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            secondNum = target - nums[i]
            if secondNum in hashMap:
                return hashMap[secondNum], i
            else:
                hashMap[nums[i]] = i
```

**Runtime**: The cost of building the hash map is $O(n)$ and the cost of finding the pair that sums to `target` is also $O(n)$. Hence the runtime is $O(n)$. The space complexity is $O(n)$ due to the need for the hash map.
