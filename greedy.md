# Greedy Algorithms

Dynamic programming could be an overkill for a number of optimization problems. For these problems, we can come up with simpler, more efficient greedy algorithms. A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution. 

The greedy method is quite powerful and works well for a wide range of prob- lems. However, greedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions, but for many problems they do. Some of the famous problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms are:
1. **[Minimum Spanning Trees](./mst.md)**
2. **[Huffman Coding](./huffman.md)**
3. **[Set Cover](./set_cover.md)**
4. Union Find
