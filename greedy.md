# Greedy Algorithms

For many optimization problems, using dynamic programming to determine the best choices is overkill; simpler, more efficient algorithms will do. A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution. 

Greedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions, but for many problems they do.
