# Greedy Algorithms

Dynamic programming could be an overkill for a number of optimization problems. For these problems, we can come up with simpler, more efficient greedy algorithms. A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at the moment. That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution. 

Greedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions, but for many problems they do. Some of the famous problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms are:
1. Minimum Spanning Trees
