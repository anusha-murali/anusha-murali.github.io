### Reversed Linked List

This is a nice problem from LeetCode (Problem #206). 

**Problem**: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

**Solution**

We are interested in counting the number of requests in the inclusive range [$t - 3000, t$]. Therefore, we maintain the requests in a queue and we repeatedly pop off the first element if its value is $< t - 3000$, where $t$ is the current time. The remaining elements in the queue constitute the requests that happened in the inclusive range [$t - 3000, t$].

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        currNode = head
        prevNode = None
        while currNode != None:
            temp = currNode.next
            currNode.next = prevNode
            prevNode = currNode
            currNode = temp
        return prevNode
```


**Runtime**: 

The time complexity is $O(1)$. This is because a `ping()` operation involves just an `append()`  to the queue and a `popleft()`, both of which are constant operations.

The space complexity is also $O(1)$ as our queue will never exceed 3000ms due to the problem definition.
