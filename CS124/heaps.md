# Heaps and Priority Queues

## Heaps

Heaps (We focus on Min-Heaps in this discussion for concreteness) are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. We refer to this condition as the **heap invariant**.

A heap is a complete binary tree except that the last level may bee missing nodes, and if so is filled from left to right.

This implementation uses arrays for which heap[$k$] <= heap[$2k+1$] and heap[$k$] $\leq$ heap[$2k+2$] for 
all $k$, counting elements from zero. Non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. 
The interesting property of a heap is that its smallest element is always the root, heap[$0$].

The min-heap shown above is represented in the form of a binary tree. It's array representation is shown below.

The number within the circle at each node in the tree is the value stored at that node. The number above a node is the corresponding index in the array. Above and below the array are lines showing parent-child relationships; parents are always to the left of their children. The tree has height three; the node at index 4 (with value 9) has height two.
